# dm2schema: A submodule committed for Manuscript 54 [MODELS22]

**Paper**: "Proving correctness for SQL implementations of OCL constraints"

## dm2schema
This project contains a module for mapping data models to SQL schemata according to the definition provided in the manuscript.
**dm2schema** can also be used as a Java parser, that is, given a data model (in JSON format), it generates a Java object representation of this datamodel.

**Note**: For the usage of this paper, this implementation will be exported to a JAR file and included as a submodule. Although it can operate as a standalone software, its functionality will not be discussed in detail here since it is out of the manuscript scope. Interested readers can find the exported JAR file [here](https://github.com/models22-submission54/dm2schema/releases/tag/v1.0).
